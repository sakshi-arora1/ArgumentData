Students continued their education online and working from home became a new reality for professionals. Reality of WFH The idea of working from home, in the beginning, was quite exciting but also challenging. Exciting, because apart from a few exceptions it was never done before and challenging because there was no prior planning and proper setup for this new way of life. Being a professional I found this new reality quite difficult. I knew that I had to deal with a lot of challenges before getting used to this new experience. Some of the challenges that I faced during the initial days were: Procrastination: For me, this was the number 1 challenge because staying home always meant vacation or a day off. So staying home and working from 9 am-5 pm was a big challenge for me, I felt like my productivity has been reduced. I used to be petrified of the piles of documents that I had to go through.
