He calls it the Write Your First Memoir Draft Program. Guest post by Denis Ledoux It is more than a course—it is a program that brings you what you need to succeed at writing your memoir: information presented in an incremental sequence you can actually learn from, practice—multiple times—in every module so you go quickly from theoretical to practical. This is a hands-on program. motivation in the form of lifestories of writers who stood where you now stand and who succeeded at writing their stories—and so can you—and accountability by way of commitments we ask you to keep with yourself and to your writing colleagues. The Write Your First Memoir Draft Program is designed to be a multi-faceted learning environment that addresses writing issues from many angles. Denis Ledoux and The Memoir Network feel confident you will be amazed at how the system we present will help you write a meaningful and thoughtful memoir.
