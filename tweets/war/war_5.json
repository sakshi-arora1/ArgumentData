Inside was a weathered piece of paper with a child’s writing. With few clues about who might have sent it, the company's manager, Brad Babb, was on a mission to find the writer through social media. After thousands of views, they received a call from Eric and Melanie Dahl, the parents of the little boy who wrote the letter. Their son and author of the note, Brian, passed away 15 years ago in an accident. Melanie, Eric, and one of their sons, Chris, traveled from Mississippi to Louisiana to meet Brad’s team and share the living memories of Brian.","unwound_url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/louisiana-ship-building-company-finds-mystery-message-in-a-bottle-146117701582"}],"annotations":[{"start":0,"end":30,"probability":0.4164,"type":"Organization","normalized_text":"Louisiana Ship Building Company"}],"mentions":[{"start":115,"end":123,"username":"NBCNews","id":"14173315"}]},"context_annotations":[{"domain":{"id":"45","name":"Brand Vertical","description":"Top level entities that describe a Brands industry"},"entity":{"id":"781974597310615553","name":"Entertainment"}},{"domain":{"id":"30","name":"Entities [Entity Service]","description":"Entity Service top level domain, every item that is in Entity Service should be in this domain"},"entity":{"id":"781974596157181956","name":"Online Site"}},{"domain":{"id":"30","name":"Entities [Entity Service]","description":"Entity Service top level domain, every item that is in Entity Service should be in this domain"},"entity":{"id":"781974597105094656","name":"TV/Movies Related - Entertainment"}},{"domain":{"id":"47","name":"Brand","description":"Brands and Companies"},"entity":{"id":"1065661450843123712","name":"NBC News","description":"NBC News"}},{"domain":{"id":"131","name":"Unified Twitter Taxonomy","description":"A taxonomy view into the Semantic Core knowledge graph"},"entity":{"id":"1046545033657081857","name":"News","description":"News"}},{"domain":{"id":"131","name":"Unified Twitter Taxonomy","description":"A taxonomy view into the Semantic Core knowledge graph"},"entity":{"id":"1065661450843123712","name":"NBC News","description":"NBC News"}},{"domain":{"id":"131","name":"Unified Twitter Taxonomy","description":"A taxonomy view into the Semantic Core knowledge graph"},"entity":{"id":"1196447117297905665","name":"News outlets"}},{"domain":{"id":"159","name":"States","description":"States, provinces, or prefectures, like California or Fukushima Prefecture"},"entity":{"id":"856862983665758209","name":"Louisiana","description":"Louisiana"}}],"id":"1558659461736177668","reply_settings":"everyone","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":5,"reply_count":1,"like_count":22,"quote_count":1},"source":"Twitter for iPhone","lang":"en"},{"created_at":"2022-08-14T21:07:06.000Z","possibly_sensitive":false,"conversation_id":"1558923189341896705","entities":{"hashtags":[{"start":140,"end":150,"tag":"Donations"},{"start":151,"end":164,"tag":"animalrescue"},{"start":165,"end":169,"tag":"war"},{"start":170,"end":178,"tag":"Ukraine"},{"start":179,"end":184,"tag":"help"},{"start":185,"end":198,"tag":"SLAVAUKRAINI"}],"urls":[{"start":201,"end":224,"url":"https://t.co/pYRiVf7rfL","expanded_url":"https://donorbox.org/support-our-animal-rescue-missions-in-kharkiv","display_url":"donorbox.org/support-our-an…","status":200,"title":"Support our Animal Rescue Missions in Kharkiv | ANIMAL RESCUE MISSION (Powered by Donorbox)","unwound_url":"https://donorbox.org/support-our-animal-rescue-missions-in-kharkiv"},{"start":225,"end":248,"url":"https://t.co/zxeoHYEPnv","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/UAanimalz/status/1558923189341896705/video/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/zxeoHYEPnv","media_key":"7_1558922883459682306"}],"annotations":[{"start":79,"end":85,"probability":0.9987,"type":"Place","normalized_text":"Ukraine"}]},"attachments":{"media_keys":["7_1558922883459682306"]},"author_id":"1528770990527991808","text":"Please help us through donating to assist in the rescue missions that we do in Ukraine.
